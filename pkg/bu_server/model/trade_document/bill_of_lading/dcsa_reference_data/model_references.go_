 * API specification issued by DCSA.org.  For explanation to specific values or objects please refer to the [Information Model 2022.Q4](https://dcsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DCSA_Information-Model-2022.Q4-final.pdf). **Please be aware that version 2022.Q4 of the Information Model includes Reefers - this API does not include Reefers.** This API does not define the business rules regarding what is allowed to update at what time. For this the [Interface Standard for the Bill of Lading 2.0](https://dcsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/12-23-2022_DCSA_Interface_Standard_Bill_of_Lading_v2.0.pdf) should be consulted.  All other documents related to the Electronic Bill of Lading publication can be found [here](https://dcsa.org/standards/ebill-of-lading/)  It is possible to use this API as a standalone API. In order to do so it is necessary to use the poll-endPoint - /v2/events  in order to poll event information.  It is recomended to implement the [DCSA Documentation Event Hub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/dcsaorg/DOCUMENTATION_EVENT_HUB) in order to use the push model. Here events are pushed as they occur.  For a changelog please click [here](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-OpenAPI/tree/master/ebl/v2#v200). Please also [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-OpenAPI/issues/new) if you have any questions/comments.
