  title: DCSA Shipping Instructions and Transport Document API
  description: |
    <h1>DCSA OpenAPI specification for the Shipping Instructions and Transport Document process</h1>

    This API is intended as an API between a carrier and anyone creating a `Shipping Instructions` and approving a `Transport Document`. The process includes:

    - Shipping Instructions submission
    - Shipping Instructions update
    - Draft Transport Document publication
    - Draft Transport Document update
    - Draft Transport Document approval

    For explanation of specific values or objects please refer to the [Information Model](https://developer.dcsa.org/documentation/information_models). This API specification does not define the allowable updates and their timing in accordance with the established business rules. **All use cases mentioned in this API specification refer to use cases defined in [DCSA Interface Standard for the Bill of Lading 3.0](https://dcsa.org/standards/bill-of-lading/documentation-bill-of-lading-3)**.

    All other documents related to the electronic Bill of Lading (referred to as `eBL`) publication can be found [here](https://dcsa.org/standards/ebill-of-lading/)

    ### eBL (Implemented by provider)

    It is possible to use the eBL API as a standalone API. In that case use one of the poll endPoints:

        GET /v3/shipping-instructions/{documentReference}  # For Shipping Instructions status
        GET /v3/transport-documents/{transportDocumentReference}  # For Transport Document status

    in order to poll information about status changes.

    **Note:** All `/v3/shipping-instructions` and `/v3/transport-documents` endPoints must be implemented by the provider.

    ### Notifications (Implemented by consumer)
    It is possible to have notifications pushed to you whenever the provider needs input and/or a state change. The format of the notification is defined by the [Shipping Instructions Notification endPoint](#/ShippingInstructionsNotification) or the [Transport Document Notification endPoint](#/TransportDocumentNotification).

        POST /v3/shipping-instructions-notifications
        POST /v3/transport-document-notifications

    The endPoints support both a lightweight Notification and a full State transfer. How much data is sent via this Notification depends on what kind of Notification is being subscribed to.

    Signing up for notifications is defined outside the scope of this API specification.

    **Note:** All of these endPoint is to be implemented by the consumers of the `Shipping Instructions API` and `Transport Document API` in order to receive push events.

    ### API Design & Implementation Principles
    This API follows the guidelines defined in version 2.0 of the API Design & Implementation Principles which can be found on the [DCSA Developer Portal](https://developer.dcsa.org/api_design)

        Creates a Shipping Instructions
      description: "Creates a new `Shipping Instructions`. This endPoint corresponds with **UseCase 1 - Submit Shipping Instructions**.\n\n## Precondition\nThe consumer has information for a `Shipping Instructions`. The empty equipment has been released to the shipper. The `Booking` is in state `CONFIRMED`.\n\n## Postcondition\nThe provider has received the `Shipping Instructions`.\n\nThe consumer will receive a `202` (Accepted) if the payload schema validates or a `400` (Bad Request) if it does not.\n\n## Flow for the `202` (Accepted) response\nThe following occurs when a provider receives a `Shipping Instructions`:\n1. The payload (`Shipping Instructions`) is schema-validated. In case the payload **is invalid** a `400` (Bad Request) is returned.\n\n   **The process stops here!**\n2. The payload is schema-valid which means:\n    - all required properties are provided.\n    - all values provided have correct data type.\n\n   A `shippingInstructionsReference` (as a reference to the `Shipping Instructions`) is created and linked to the payload in the provider system.\n  \n   **For the rest of this description and in all examples the value `si-123` will be used as `shippingInstructionsReference`**\n\n3. A `202` (Accepted) response is returned with a payload containing **only** the `shippingInstructionsReference`:\n    ```\n    {\n      shippingInstructionsReference: 'si-123'\n    }\n    ```\n\nFor `POST` `Shipping Instructions` the process ends here. The `Shipping Instructions`:\n  - is now accepted by the provider system\n  - the `Shipping Instructions` does not yet have any status and cannot be queried (no `GET` request is possible until the `Shipping Instructions` is further processed in the provider system)\n  - a `202` (Accepted) response is sent to the consumer with a payload **only** containing the `shippingInstructionsReference`\n  - awaits further processing by the provider\n\nThe provider will now start asynchronous processing. Once processed, the  status `RECEIVED` of the `Shipping Instructions` will be communicated via a [Shipping Instructions Notification](#/ShippingInstructionsNotification). In case the consumer does not subscribe to notifications it is necessary for the consumer to poll on the\n\n    GET /v3/shipping-instructions/{documentReference}\n    \n  endPoint to check if the `shippingInstructionsStatus` of the `Shipping Instructions` has changed.\n  \n  After the status has changed to `RECEIVED` further processing can continue by provider and will be communicated via a [Shipping Instructions Notification](#/ShippingInstructionsNotification).\n"

        Gets the Shipping Instructions
      description: |
        Retrieves the `Shipping Instructions` with the `documentReference`. The path can contain a `shippingInstructionsReference` or a `transportDocumentReference`. It is recommended to use this endPoint to `GET` data before an update is made to make sure latest version is being updated.

        The default payload when calling this endPoint is the "original" `Shipping Instructions`. It is also possible to get the latest update to a `Shipping Instructions` called the `Updated Shipping Instructions`. In order to get the `Update Shipping Instructions`, it is necessary to use the query parameter `updatedContent` and set it to `true`.

            GET /v3/shipping-instructions/{documentReference}?updatedContent=true

        The `status` of the "original" `Shipping Instructions` is included in both payloads as `shippingInstructionsStatus`. `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus` and related content is only available after a consumer has requested an update via **UseCase 3: Submit updated Shipping Instructions** and until:
        - the provider requests for a new update (**UseCase 2: Request to update Shipping Instructions**) in which case the "old update" is no longer accessible.
        - the consumer submits a new update (**UseCase 3: Submit updated Shipping Instructions**) in which case the "new update" provided **replaces** the "old update".

        If `updatedContent=true` is requested but no update has yet been provided by the consumer **or** the state of the "original" `Shipping Instructions` is `PENDING_UPDATE`, then a `404` (Not Found) is returned.

        If the provider is requesting changes to the `Shipping Instructions`, the `Feedback` object is used to inform the consumer what needs to change.

        In case no subscription (`Notification`) has been set up - it is possible to use this endPoint to poll on in order to detect if `shippingInstructionsStatus` and/or `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus` has changed.

        In case a previous request is being processed by the provider - a `202` (Accepted) with **no payload** can be used as a response until the processing is finished.

        Updates the Shipping Instructions
      description: "Updates the `Shipping Instructions` with the `documentReference`. The path can contain one of a `shippingInstructionsReference` or a `transportDocumentReference`. This endPoint corresponds with **UseCase 3 - Submit updated Shipping Instructions**\n\n### Precondition\nIn order to update a `Shipping Instructions`, the status of the `Shipping Instructions` needs to be in state:\n\n- `RECEIVED` in case the consumer has updated information for the `Shipping Instructions`\n- `PENDING_UPDATE` in case the provider has requested the consumer to update the `Shipping Instructions` (a result of **UseCase 2 - Request to update Shipping Instructions**)\n\nThe status of `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus` can be anything.\n\n## Postcondition\nThe provider has received an update to the `Shipping Instructions` (**UseCase 3 - Submit updated Shipping Instructions**). In case this is the first update to the `Shipping Instructions` the update will be called the `Updated Shipping Instructions`. If this is a subsequent update to the `Shipping Instructions` - the update will update the `Updated Shipping Instructions`. In both cases the `updatedShippingInstructionStatus` will be set to `UPDATE_RECEIVED`.\n\nThe `Updated Shipping Instructions` and the \"original\" `Shipping Instructions` **co-exist** until a new update is submitted by the consumer (via **UseCase 3: Submit updated Shipping Instructions**) in which case the new update replaces the existing. Or until the provider requests an update (sets the `shippingInstructionsStatus='PENDING_UPDATE'` via **UseCase 2: Request to update Shipping Instructions**). The `Updated Shipping Instructions` always represents the latest version of an update received by the provider.\n\nThe consumer will receive a `202` (Accepted) if the payload schema-validates or a `400` (Bad Request) if it does not.\n\n## Flow for the `202` (Accepted) response\nThe following occurs when a provider receives an **update** to a `Shipping Instructions`\n1. The payload (`Updated Shipping Instructions`) is schema-validated. In case the payload **is invalid** a `400` (Bad Request) is returned.\n\n   **The process stops here!**\n2. The payload is schema-valid which means:\n    - all required properties are provided\n    - all values provided have correct data type.\n3. An empty response is returned and the consumer now awaits further processing by the provider.\n\nFor `PUT` `Shipping Instructions` the process ends here. The `Shipping Instructions`:\n  - is now accepted by the provider system\n  - the status of the `Shipping Instructions` is unchanged\n  - a `202` (Accepted) response is sent with an empty payload\n  - awaits further processing by the provider\n\nThe provider will now start asynchronous processing. Once processed, the state will change to one of the following values depending on the use case for calling the `PUT` endPoint:\n  - `shippingInstructionsStatus='RECEIVED'` and `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus='UPDATE_RECEIVED'` (if endPoint is used to make an update to a Submitted Shipping Instructions - **UseCase 1 - Submit Shipping Instructions**)\n  - `shippingInstructionsStatus='PENDING_UPDATE'` and `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus='UPDATE_RECEIVED'` (if endPoint is used as a response to **UseCase 2 - Request to update Shipping Instructions**)\n\nThe new state will be communicated via a [Shipping Instructions Notification](#/ShippingInstructionsNotification). In case the consumer does not subscribe to notifications it is necessary for the consumer to poll on the\n\n    GET /v3/shipping-instructions/{documentReference}\n    \nendPoint to check if the `shippingInstructionsStatus` and `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus` of the `Shipping Instructions` has changed.\n  \nIf the consumer wants to get the content of the `Update Shipping Instructions` provided via this `PUT` endPoint,  the `GET` endPoint needs to be used in combination with the `?updatedContent=true` queryParameter:\n  \n    GET /v3/shipping-instructions/{documentReference}?updatedContent=true\n    \nIt is possible to `GET` the content of the `Updated Shipping Instructions` via the example above until one of:\n  - the provider requests for a new update (**UseCase 2: Request to update Shipping Instructions**) in which case the \"old update\" is no longer accessible\n  - the consumer submits a new update (**UseCase 3: Submit updated Shipping Instructions**) in which case the \"new update\" provided **replaces** the \"old update\".\n"

        Cancels an update to a Shipping Instructions
      description: "A way for the consumer to Cancel an `Updated Shipping Instructions`. This endPoint corresponds with **UseCase 5 - Cancel update to Shipping Instructions**.\n\n## Precondition\nIn order to cancel an `Updated Shipping Instructions`, the status of the `Updated Shipping Instructions` must be in in status `UPDATE_RECEIVED`. The status of the `Shipping Instructions` can be one of `RECEIVED` or `PENDING_UPDATE`.\n\n## Postcondition\nThe provider has received a cancellation from the consumer for an `Updated Shipping Instructions` that is in state `UPDATE_RECEIVED`.\n\nThe consumer will receive a `202` (Accepted) if the payload schema-validates or a `400` (Bad Request) if it does not.\n\n## Flow for the `202` (Accepted) response\nThe following occurs when a provider receives a cancellation:\n1. The payload is schema-validated. In case the payload **is invalid** a `400` (Bad Request) is returned.\n\n   **The process stops here!**\n2. The payload is schema-valid which means:\n    - all required properties are provided.\n    - all values provided have correct data type.\n3. An empty response is returned and the consumer now awaits further processing by the provider.\n\nOnce processed, the `Updated Shipping Instructions` is cancelled and a [Shipping Instructions Notification](#/ShippingInstructionsNotification) will be sent. In case the consumer does not subscribe to notifications it is necessary for the consumer to poll on the\n\n    GET /v3/shipping-instructions/{documentReference}\n    \nendPoint to check if the `shippingInstructionsStatus` and `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus` of the `Shipping Instructions` has changed.\n"

The payload is schema-validated. In case the payload **is invalid** a `400` (Bad Request) is returned.\n\n   **The process stops here!**\n2. The payload is schema-valid which means:\n    - all required properties are provided.\n    - all values provided have correct data type.\n3. An empty response is returned and the consumer now awaits further processing by the provider.\n\nOnce processed, the `Transport Document` is `ISSUED` and a [Transport Document Notification](#/TransportDocumentNotification) is sent. In case the consumer does not subscribe to notifications it is necessary for the consumer to poll on the\n\n    GET /v3/transport-documents/{transportDocumentReference}\n    \nendPoint to check if the `transportDocumentStatus` of the `Transport Document` has changed.\n"

            The version of the CloudEvents specification which the event uses. This enables the interpretation of the context. Compliant event producers MUST use a value of `1.0` when referring to this version of the specification.

            Currently, this attribute will only have the 'major' and 'minor' version numbers included in it. This allows for 'patch' changes to the specification to be made without changing this property's value in the serialization. Note: for 'release candidate' releases a suffix might be used for testing purposes.
          example: "1.0"
          enum:
          - "1.0"
        id:
          maxLength: 100
          type: string
          description: |
            Identifies the event. Producers MUST ensure that `source` + `id` is unique for each distinct event. If a duplicate event is re-sent (e.g. due to a network error) it MAY have the same `id`. Consumers MAY assume that Events with identical `source` and `id` are duplicates.
          example: 3cecb101-7a1a-43a4-9d62-e88a131651e2
        source:
          maxLength: 4096
          type: string
          description: |
            Identifies the context in which an event happened. Often this will include information such as the type of the event source, the organization publishing the event or the process that produced the event. The exact syntax and semantics behind the data encoded in the URI is defined by the event producer.

            Producers MUST ensure that `source` + `id` is unique for each distinct event.

            An application MAY assign a unique `source` to each distinct producer, which makes it easy to produce unique IDs since no other producer will have the same source. The application MAY use UUIDs, URNs, DNS authorities or an application-specific scheme to create unique `source` identifiers.

            A source MAY include more than one producer. In that case the producers MUST collaborate to ensure that `source` + `id` is unique for each distinct event.

          type: string

            This attribute contains a value describing the type of event related to the originating occurrence. Often this attribute is used for routing, observability, policy enforcement, etc. The format of this is producer defined and might include information such as the version of the type - see [Versioning of CloudEvents in the Primer](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/primer.md#versioning-of-cloudevents) for more information.
          example: org.dcsa.shipping-instructions.v3
          enum:
          - org.dcsa.shipping-instructions.v3
        time:
          type: string
          description: |
            Timestamp of when the occurrence happened. If the time of the occurrence cannot be determined then this attribute MAY be set to some other time (such as the current time) by the CloudEvents producer, however all producers for the same `source` MUST be consistent in this respect. In other words, either they all use the actual time of the occurrence or they all use the same algorithm to determine the value used.
          format: date-time
          example: 2018-04-05T17:31:00Z
        datacontenttype:
          type: string
          description: |
            Content type of `data` value. This attribute enables `data` to carry any type of content, whereby format and encoding might differ from that of the chosen event format. For example, an event rendered using the [JSON envelope](formats/json-format.md#3-envelope) format might carry an XML payload in `data`, and the consumer is informed by this attribute being set to "application/xml". The rules for how `data` content is rendered for different `datacontenttype` values are defined in the event format specifications; for example, the JSON event format defines the relationship in [section 3.1](formats/json-format.md#31-handling-of-data).

            For some binary mode protocol bindings, this field is directly mapped to the respective protocol's content-type metadata property. Normative rules for the binary mode and the content-type metadata mapping can be found in the respective protocol.

            In some event formats the `datacontenttype` attribute MAY be omitted. For example, if a JSON format event has no `datacontenttype` attribute, then it is implied that the `data` is a JSON value conforming to the "application/json" media type. In other words: a JSON-format event with no `datacontenttype` is exactly equivalent to one with `datacontenttype="application/json"`.

            When translating an event message with no `datacontenttype` attribute to a different format or protocol binding, the target `datacontenttype` SHOULD be set explicitly to the implied `datacontenttype` of the source.
          example: application/json
          enum:
          - application/json
        subscriptionReference:
          maxLength: 100

          description: |
            The version of the CloudEvents specification which the event uses. This enables the interpretation of the context. Compliant event producers MUST use a value of `1.0` when referring to this version of the specification.

            Currently, this attribute will only have the 'major' and 'minor' version numbers included in it. This allows for 'patch' changes to the specification to be made without changing this property's value in the serialization. Note: for 'release candidate' releases a suffix might be used for testing purposes.
          example: "1.0"
          enum:
          - "1.0"
        id:
          maxLength: 100
          type: string
          description: |
            Identifies the event. Producers MUST ensure that `source` + `id` is unique for each distinct event. If a duplicate event is re-sent (e.g. due to a network error) it MAY have the same `id`. Consumers MAY assume that Events with identical `source` and `id` are duplicates.
          example: 3cecb101-7a1a-43a4-9d62-e88a131651e2
        source:
          maxLength: 4096
          type: string
          description: |
            Identifies the context in which an event happened. Often this will include information such as the type of the event source, the organization publishing the event or the process that produced the event. The exact syntax and semantics behind the data encoded in the URI is defined by the event producer.

            Producers MUST ensure that `source` + `id` is unique for each distinct event.

            An application MAY assign a unique `source` to each distinct producer, which makes it easy to produce unique IDs since no other producer will have the same source. The application MAY use UUIDs, URNs, DNS authorities or an application-specific scheme to create unique `source` identifiers.

            A source MAY include more than one producer. In that case the producers MUST collaborate to ensure that `source` + `id` is unique for each distinct event.

          type: string
          description: |
            This attribute contains a value describing the type of event related to the originating occurrence. Often this attribute is used for routing, observability, policy enforcement, etc. The format of this is producer defined and might include information such as the version of the type - see [Versioning of CloudEvents in the Primer](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/primer.md#versioning-of-cloudevents) for more information.
          example: org.dcsa.transport-document.v3
          enum:
          - org.dcsa.transport-document.v3
        time:
          type: string
          description: |
            Timestamp of when the occurrence happened. If the time of the occurrence cannot be determined then this attribute MAY be set to some other time (such as the current time) by the CloudEvents producer, however all producers for the same `source` MUST be consistent in this respect. In other words, either they all use the actual time of the occurrence or they all use the same algorithm to determine the value used.
          format: date-time
          example: 2018-04-05T17:31:00Z
        datacontenttype:
          type: string
          description: |
            Content type of `data` value. This attribute enables `data` to carry any type of content, whereby format and encoding might differ from that of the chosen event format. For example, an event rendered using the [JSON envelope](formats/json-format.md#3-envelope) format might carry an XML payload in `data`, and the consumer is informed by this attribute being set to "application/xml". The rules for how `data` content is rendered for different `datacontenttype` values are defined in the event format specifications; for example, the JSON event format defines the relationship in [section 3.1](formats/json-format.md#31-handling-of-data).

            For some binary mode protocol bindings, this field is directly mapped to the respective protocol's content-type metadata property. Normative rules for the binary mode and the content-type metadata mapping can be found in the respective protocol.

            In some event formats the `datacontenttype` attribute MAY be omitted. For example, if a JSON format event has no`datacontenttype` attribute, then it is implied that the `data` is a JSON value conforming to the "application/json" media type. In other words: a JSON-format event with no `datacontenttype` is exactly equivalent to one with `datacontenttype="application/json"`.

            When translating an event message with no `datacontenttype` attribute to a different format or protocol binding, the target `datacontenttype` SHOULD be set explicitly to the implied `datacontenttype` of the source.
